# LinkedIn API Integration Research

## Overview
The issue requests adding live posts from LinkedIn, fetched via API if possible.

## LinkedIn API Analysis

### Current State (2025)
LinkedIn has significantly restricted their API access since 2018. The available options are:

### 1. LinkedIn Sign In API (Limited Access)
- **What it provides**: Basic profile information only
- **Posts access**: NOT available for personal/individual developer accounts
- **Requirements**: Approved partnership with LinkedIn

### 2. LinkedIn Marketing API
- **What it provides**: Access to company pages and advertising
- **Posts access**: Limited to company pages you manage
- **Requirements**: LinkedIn Marketing Partner status

### 3. LinkedIn Content API
- **What it provides**: Ability to post content on behalf of users
- **Posts access**: Can post TO LinkedIn, but cannot READ posts
- **Requirements**: Member permissions and app approval

## Current Limitations
1. **Personal Posts**: LinkedIn does not allow third-party applications to fetch personal posts/feed
2. **Authentication**: Would require complex OAuth flow
3. **Rate Limits**: Strict API rate limiting
4. **Approval Process**: LinkedIn requires app review and approval for most API access

## Alternative Solutions
1. **Static Content**: Manually curate LinkedIn highlights
2. **RSS Integration**: Some third-party services provide LinkedIn RSS feeds (reliability varies)
3. **Screenshot/Link Integration**: Link to LinkedIn profile with static content

## Recommendation
Given LinkedIn's API restrictions, implementing live post fetching is **not feasible** for a personal portfolio website without:
- LinkedIn Partnership status
- Complex authentication flow
- Ongoing maintenance for API changes

## Implementation Decision
**Status**: Not implemented due to API limitations
**Alternative**: Added note for future consideration when LinkedIn API policies change
